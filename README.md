# Boilerplate
A relly simple boilerplate I use for Sassâ€“based, static projects, prototypes and wireframes.

## Sass Grid
Really simple Sass setup including a grid system I made for quick prototypes.

## Icon Font
Uses Symbolset, I haven't included the font files in the repo, because I'm not a dick. [Go and buy them](https://symbolset.com/).

## JS/jQuery
None yet, some soon.

## Sass
Run `sass --watch assets/sass/screen.scss:assets/css/screen.css`
